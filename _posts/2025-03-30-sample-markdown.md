The HW was to make a circuit with one LED, and two homemade switches: one from conductive thread patches and one from additional material.
I used a paper clip as the additional material. 
I wanted the dot in the "i" in "Williams" to be an LED. The moon shaped conducive fabric to follow the curve of the "S" in "Williams."
One piece of advice for myself is to get more creative and fun with it! Next time I will try to make something less boring.
