The HW was to make a circuit with one LED, and two homemade switches: one from conductive thread patches and one from additional material.
I used a paper clip as the additional material. 

Here is a photo of the front:
I wanted the dot in the "i" in "Williams" to be an LED. The moon shaped conducive fabric to follow the curve of the "S" in "Williams."
