### My first post!

My name is **Gabriela Maria Cord√≥n** (_she/her_). You can call me Gaby. I am a senior at Williams College. I am studying **Art History** and **Studio Art** with a concentration in **Science and Technology Studies**. Also, I intern at **Williams College Museum of Art** in the communications department. You can find their website, as well as Williams main website, under the _resources_ tab! 

I started taking sewing classes when I was nine years old. I learned how to make quilted pillows to princess lined dresses to tailored pants. I stopped taking classes at the end of my sixth year when I was fifteen. And i miss it dearly.

I have little programming experience from freshman year of highschool but that learning is long forgotten.

This semester, I hope I will learn the basics of coding. My dad studied and my little sister is currently studying computer science, so I hope I will be able to understand what they are talking about during Thanksgiving dinner. More seriously, I am excited to grow my patience and resilience this semester. So far, I can tell coding is detailed-oriented and specific (which is very daunting). Therefore, I hope that during the semester, I will get better at finding that one line or word of code thats stopping the code from working, and in doing so, proving to myself that I can learn something new.

Lastly, one boring fact about me is that I loved marine biology in middle school.
