My name is **Gabriela Maria Cord√≥n** (she/her). You can call me Gaby. I am a senior at Williams College. I am studying Art History and Studio Art with a concentration in Science and Technology Studies. 

I started taking sewing classes when I was nine years old. I learned how to make quilted pillows to princess lined dresses to tailored pants. I stopped taking classes at the end of my sixth year when I was fifteen. 

I have little programming experience from freshman year of highschool but that learning is long forgotten.

This semester, I hope I will learn about resilience and patience. So far, I can tell coding is detailed-oriented and specific, which is very daunting. I hope I will find that one line or word of code thats holding back the code from working, and in doing so, proving to myself that I can learn something new. 

Lastly, one boring fact about me is that
