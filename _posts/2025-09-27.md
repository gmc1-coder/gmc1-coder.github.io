### My Plushy! 

Include a description of the project (in your words)

One tip/trick/hint for others attempting this project for the first time

I made a plushy with dark blue felt and aqua embrodiery floss. I made a flower design on the eye where I filled in only one petal. Then, I made it seem as though the flower was crying by having petals falling. 

One tip I would have for others attempting this project would be to double check if the LED is working after you sew around the negative or positive end three times. It ias always good to double check!
