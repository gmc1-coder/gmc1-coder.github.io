title: ABOUT ME
subtitle: why electronic textiles?
---

My name is Gabriela Maria Cord√≥n but you can call me **Gaby**. 

I am in **CSCI 103**: _Electronic Textiles_ because I am an avid sewer and interested in all things related to textiles. At the same time, I am interested in the points where science and art converge. I am excited to see how artistic designs will influence the code I type, and vice versa how the different code I learn will lead me down new artistic paths.
